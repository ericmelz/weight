# TODO
* Line chart of weight by date
  * Matplotlib
  * Plotly
  * Streamlit
  * Customizable by date range sliders
    * by year / month / days
* Maybe: interpolate missing values to get regular numbers, to make histogram fair
* Histogram
  * density, kde curve
* Dashboard that accepts a weight number as an input
  * Output:
    * percentile (e.g., 74.5lbs is in the bottom 23rd percentile)
    * visualization on the histogram distribution
* Breakdown of weight loss attempts
  * e.g., last year - analyze what happened
  * longest run
* PDF report of weight stories
  * overall stats (max, min, avg)
  * weight variations per day / week month
  * diet success
    * weight loss and gain
